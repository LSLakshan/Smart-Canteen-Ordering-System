# LOGO1.JPG INSTRUCTIONS

## To add your logo1.jpg file:

### Step 1: Prepare Your Logo
- Make sure your logo file is in JPG format
- Rename it to exactly "logo1.jpg" (lowercase)
- Recommended specifications:
  * Size: 200x200 pixels or larger
  * Aspect ratio: Square (1:1) works best
  * File size: Keep under 500KB for fast loading
  * Quality: High quality for crisp display

### Step 2: Add the File
1. Copy your "logo1.jpg" file
2. Paste it into this folder: `frontend/src/assets/images/`
3. Replace this instruction file when you add the actual logo

### Step 3: The Code is Ready!
- The Login component is already updated to use logo1.jpg
- No additional code changes needed
- The logo will display as 80x80 pixels with rounded corners

### Current Status:
❌ logo1.jpg file is missing - please add your actual JPG logo file
✅ Code is updated and ready to use the JPG logo

### Note:
- If you want to use a different filename, update the import in Login.jsx:
  `import logo from "../assets/images/your-logo-name.jpg";`
